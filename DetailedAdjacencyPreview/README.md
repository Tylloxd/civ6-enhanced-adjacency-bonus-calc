## 📖 Description

The **Detailed Adjacency Preview** mod enhances Civilization VI's district placement system by showing the adjacency benefits that **existing districts would receive** from new district placements. This provides complete information about mutual adjacency benefits, enabling more strategic city planning decisions.

### 🎯 What This Mod Does

When you're placing a new district, the game normally shows you what benefits the new district will receive. This mod **additionally** shows you what benefits your existing districts will gain from the new placement, displayed as floating overlays on the map.

**Example**: When placing an Aqueduct next to your Industrial Zone, you'll see a "+2 🔧" overlay on the Industrial Zone showing the production bonus it will receive.

## ✨ Features

- **Complete Adjacency Information**: See both incoming and outgoing adjacency benefits
- **Real-Time Visual Overlays**: Benefits displayed as floating text over existing districts  
- **Game-Style Integration**: Matches Civilization VI's existing UI aesthetics
- **Performance Optimized**: Intelligent caching and throttled updates
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with all district types, game modes, and DLC content
