# Task List: Detailed Adjacency Preview Mod for Civilization VI

## Relevant Files

- `DetailedAdjacencyPreview.modinfo` - ✅ CREATED - Mod definition file containing metadata, dependencies, and configuration.
- `Scripts/DetailedAdjacencyPreview_Core.lua` - ✅ CREATED - Core adjacency calculation engine with data structures and benefit calculation functions.
- `Data/DetailedAdjacencyPreview_Config.xml` - Configuration settings for the mod including visual styling parameters.
- `Data/DetailedAdjacencyPreview_Districts.xml` - District type definitions and adjacency rule mappings.
- `UI/DetailedAdjacencyPreview.lua` - Main Lua script handling UI integration and overlay display logic.
- `UI/DetailedAdjacencyPreview.xml` - UI context definitions and event bindings for the overlay system.
- `Scripts/DetailedAdjacencyPreview_Utils.lua` - Utility functions for data processing and caching.
- `Localization/DetailedAdjacencyPreview_Text.xml` - Text strings for UI elements (if needed for debugging/options).
- `Assets/DetailedAdjacencyPreview_Icons.dds` - Custom icon assets for benefit type symbols (if needed).

### Notes

- Civilization VI mods use XML for data definitions and Lua for scripting logic
- ModBuddy automatically handles file compilation and deployment to the Mods directory
- All UI modifications must integrate with the existing game's UI context system
- Performance testing should be done with large cities containing multiple districts
- Compatibility testing should include base game + all DLC combinations
