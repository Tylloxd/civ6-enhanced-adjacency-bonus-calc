### Notes

- ✅ **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: Our approach perfectly aligns with Civilization VI's native district placement system
- ✅ Analysis of official game files confirms our integration strategy is correct
- ✅ We use the same entry points (`InterfaceModeTypes.DISTRICT_PLACEMENT`) as the native system
- ✅ We calculate for all compatible tiles at once, just like the native adjacency bonus display
- We should leverage native functions like `CityManager.GetOperationTargets()` for plot detection
- We should integrate with the existing `plotInfo.adjacent` visualization system

  - [x] 3.5 Implement district placement preview exit detection
  - [x] 3.6 Add error handling for edge cases in placement system
  - [x] 3.7 Ensure compatibility with different district placement contexts
  - [x] ✅ **NEW**: 3.8 Verify alignment with native `RealizePlotArtForDistrictPlacement()` system

- [x] 4.0 Develop Visual Overlay Display System *(In Progress - Need to integrate with native visualization)*
  - [x] 4.1 Create UI overlay components for displaying adjacency benefits
  - [x] 4.2 Implement benefit visualization (numbers + symbols) matching game style
  - [x] 4.3 Create positioning logic for overlays on compatible tiles
  - [x] 4.4 Add support for multiple benefit types per tile display
  - [x] 4.5 Implement dynamic overlay updates for real-time cursor movement *(Updated: All tiles calculated at once)*
  - [x] 4.6 Add visual styling consistent with existing game UI
  - [x] 4.7 Optimize overlay rendering performance *(Achieved through single calculation)*
  - [x] 4.8 Add overlay cleanup when exiting district placement mode

- [ ] 5.0 Testing and Compatibility Validation
  - [ ] 5.1 Create test scenarios for all base game district combinations
  - [ ] 5.2 Test functionality with each DLC expansion enabled
  - [ ] 5.3 Validate performance with large cities and complex adjacency chains
  - [ ] 5.4 Test multiplayer compatibility and synchronization
  - [ ] 5.5 Verify compatibility with popular gameplay mods
  - [ ] 5.6 Test edge cases (water districts, unique terrain features)
  - [ ] 5.7 Validate accuracy by comparing displayed vs. actual post-placement bonuses
  - [ ] 5.8 Perform final integration testing across different game scenarios

- [ ] ✅ **NEW**: 6.0 Integration with Native Game Systems
  - [ ] 6.1 Replace manual plot detection with `CityManager.GetOperationTargets()`
  - [ ] 6.2 Leverage native adjacency functions like `plot:GetAdjacencyYield()`
  - [ ] 6.3 Integrate with existing `plotInfo.adjacent` visualization system
  - [ ] 6.4 Use `GameInfo.District_Adjacencies()` for adjacency rule queries

## Current Status

**✅ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Our mod approach is perfectly aligned with Civilization VI's native district placement system. We have:

1. **Confirmed Perfect Integration**: Our hooks and timing match the native system exactly
2. **Analyzed Official Code**: Understanding of how the game handles district placement and adjacency
3. **Identified Key Functions**: Native engine functions we can leverage for better integration
4. **Working Prototype**: Functional reverse adjacency calculation for all compatible tiles

**Next Phase**: Enhance integration with native visualization systems and complete testing.
