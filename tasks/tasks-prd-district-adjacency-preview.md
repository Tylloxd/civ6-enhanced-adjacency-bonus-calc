# Tasks for District Adjacency Preview Mod

## Relevant Files

- `DistrictAdjacencyPreview.modinfo` - Mod definition and configuration file
- `DistrictAdjacencyPreview.lua` - Main logic for district adjacency calculations and game integration
- `UI/DistrictAdjacencyPreview_UI.lua` - UI handling and display logic
- `UI/DistrictAdjacencyPreviewContext.xml` - UI layout and visual elements definition
- `Config/config.sql` - Database modifications and queries for district data
